# My personal configs for:

1) VScode (Main editor)
   Minimalistic design and clean interface. New fonts, icons, themes and worskpace organization.

2) Zed (Favorite editor)
   Added new keybindings to allow some features from VScode that weren't available by default. Also costumized theme and some workspace configs.

3) Neovim (For when I'm feeling brave)
   Extensions and packer configs, remaps and theme configuration.
